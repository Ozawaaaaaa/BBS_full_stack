Member: Wei Chen, Dasheng Gu, Xiang Pan, Yunze Zhu

Basically in this project we designed and implemented a forum(or BBS) which we assumed to provide a platform for users discussing code stuffs in the internet. 

This project is based on the framework of React App, with use of other APIs including kinvey database, and MVC Framework.

Generally, this forum app achieve in giving users resources to post messages on the internet. Login as an normal user, one can make a post, edit his or her post, or give other post comments. When login as an Admin, a user would be able to manage the platform, deleting comments, and posts, besides regular operations. 

We have built a rating system for the posts on the website. There is a line of 5 stars shown next to the post's title. When more visitors view the post, the star would increaes, 1 for 10, 2 for 20, etc.

We also implemented a filter for posts alerad on website.
